 # React + Vite + React Router + TailwindCSS

This project is a learning playground where I’m exploring React Router for building navigation and routing in React applications. It is set up with Vite for fast development, React Router for handling routes, and TailwindCSS for styling with utility-first classes.

Features

⚡ Vite for blazing-fast builds and HMR

🛣️ React Router for client-side routing

🎨 TailwindCSS for utility-based styling

🔄 Fast Refresh support for quick iteration
